# Contribution Guide
DO NOT make any changes based on the main branch.
ALL documents should be handed up in a NEW branch through a pull request, and be merged into the main branch.

1. Create a new branch named with your English name and University, like `Ray-CQUPT`.
2. Create a markdown file under the folder of `members` and name it with your English name like `Ray`.
3. In this file, write a slogan with heading 1, like `I'm TCer!!!`
